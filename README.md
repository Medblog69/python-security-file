You are a security professional working in a healthcare company. As part of your job, you are required to regularly update a file that identifies employees who are allowed to access restricted content. The content of the file is based on the people who work with patient records. The access of IPSs is restricted based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the restricted subnet. There is also a remove list that identifies employees that you need to remove from this allow list.

Your task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check if the allow list contains IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, you need to remove these IP addresses from the allow list file.
